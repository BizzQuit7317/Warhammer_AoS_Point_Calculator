# Warhammer_AoS_Point_Calculator
Powered by wahapedia, a simple script to scrape the html of the page and return the points for a unit.

# To Do:
- Check the points break doesnt have any obvious issues
- Parse number after break point to consistently return only integers
- Implement some simple checking on names that return a 404, potentially just adding an s or something
- Connect to csv so I can check result and have a better view of data when debuggin
- Connect to discord bot for test
- Make discord bot function (no idea what that entails)
