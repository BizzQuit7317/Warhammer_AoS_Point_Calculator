# Warhammer_AoS_Point_Calculator
Powered by wahapedia, a simple script to scrape the html of the page and return the points for a unit.

# To Do:
- Implement a list building option
- See viability of adding model points to !check_units (points may be a good way to filter and find model names)
- Do some formatting so it looks a little nice at least
- Check size and memory if it can fit on a small aws server in the background
- Maybe rewrite in rust if we feel like a chad
- Never use since it gonna be more convinent to just usse the website XDDDDDDD
