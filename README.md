Powered by wahapedia, a simple script to scrape the html of the page and return the points for a unit.

# To Do:
- 
- 

# Ideas:
when retrying names I want 2 methods, first keeping a track of like common mispellings, things like users writing skink when its listed as skink**S**.
depending on efficency and data storage might noot be feasable.
Trying common mistakes, if this works well might not need first, but again trying to pluralise things or adding with or something other spot, 
this will be more limited by time retrying ssomething, could use async function to send multiple retry requests or for multi unit lists then have it re roll on units it cannot find.
